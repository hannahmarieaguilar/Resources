# Relationship Between Nano/VIM/VSCode, Script Files, + Different Programming Languages 

- You can use Nano/VIM/VSCode to write script files
    - nano (exit using ^X)
    - VIM (exit using :q!)
    - VSCode (just make a test file)

- You can use script files to write the code you want to execute. Using script files is important for saving as well as sharing information.
  - once you pick nano/VIM/VSCode you will write a script file in them

|Examples | Extension|
|--------|------------|
| Bash | .sh|
| Python | .py|
|R | .r|
|yaml | .yaml|
|snakemake | .smk|

Note: extensions are indicators of what language the script should be written in, but this is not always the case.

- You can use different programming languages depending on what you need to do and how efficiently the program can compute that task.
    - R (can be used for beautiful visualizations (ggplot) and statistics (dplyr))
    - Python (good for parsing and building tables (Pandas))
    - Rust
    - Julia
    - C/C++
    - Java/JavaScript
